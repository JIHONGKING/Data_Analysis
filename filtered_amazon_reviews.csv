It is a blend of regular and dutched cocoa(dutching is a process that removes some of the acidity of cocoa, giving it a more mellow flavor). It has the most agreeable true cocoa flavor of all the brands. It also has a very fluffy texture. It is a pity that it is sometimes hard to find. Strangely, even though I buy it at popular chain stores, I find some particular stores in the chain will carry it while others in the same chain will not. If you are lucky enough to find this, buy it! Of course, you can also purchase it online...hopefully.<br />Keep in mind that this is a low fat, very low calorie(it is not sweetened), healthy food that can be used to make some very healthy and fun foods!","Positive"

The Shell cracked all over (think drought stricken dirt) and had sticky hairlike strands all over one side.
